*Question 1a:
sum child_college if mother_education <= 12
*Answer: 18.18182% of children whose parents had a high school education or less went on to receive a college degree or higher. (The mean of child_college with these conditions was .1818182.)


*Question 1b:
*Answer: Yes, my estimate of 18.18% is close to professor's calculation of 20.9%.


*Question 2a:
egen kid_inc_rank = rank(kid_income)
sum kid_inc_rank
replace kid_inc_rank = 100*kid_inc_rank/r(max)


*Question 2b:
egen parent_inc_rank = rank(parent_inc)
sum parent_inc_rank
replace parent_inc_rank = 100*parent_inc_rank /r(max)


*Question 3a:
twoway (scatter kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank) ///
(lfit kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank), name(s, replace)

graph export figure1.png, replace


*Question 3b:
binscatter kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank, name(b, replace)
graph export figure2.png, replace


*Question 4:
regress kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank
*Intercept:  31.41826
*Estimated slope: .3727907  


*Question 5a:
display _b[_cons] + 25*_b[parent_inc_rank]
*Answer: The predicted child income rank from the rank-rank regression in question 4 is 40.738031. It is very close to the value of 41.3 reported in Raj Chetty's 2014 report.

*Question 5b:
display 100*.3727907

display (_b[_cons] + 100*_b[parent_inc_rank]) - /// 
(_b[_cons] + 0*_b[parent_inc_rank])
*Answer: The relatively mobility is 37.279072. It is a bit off from the value reported in Raj Chetty's 2014 report.

*Question 5c:

*Identify children who reach the top 5th:
gen top20 = 0
replace top20 = 1 if kid_inc_rank > 80

*Proportion of those in the top 5th whose parents were in the bottom 5th:
sum top20 if parent_inc_rank < 20
*There are so many ways to answer this question!

*Answer: The Horatio Alger measure is 7.37034. It is relatively close to the measure calculated using full population tax data (Chetty et al. 2014). 

*Question 5d:

*$1 in 1997 would be worth $1.4767 in 2015
gen more_than_parents = 0
replace more_than_parents = 1 /// 
if kid_income > 1.4767*parent_inc

sum more_than_parents
*Answer: 50.89318 of children make more in inflation-adjusted dollars than their parents. This is very close to the value of 50% reported in Raj Chetty's 2017 report.

*Question 6:
regress kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank if (female == 0 & black == 1)
*Black men - Intercept: 25.70348, Estimated slope: .29432
regress kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank if (female == 0 & white == 1)
*White men - Intercept: 40.11022, Estimated slope: .266921


display _b[_cons] + 25*_b[parent_inc_rank]  
*Absolute mobility at the 25th percentile for Black men: 33.061475
display _b[_cons] + 25*_b[parent_inc_rank]  
*Absolute mobility at the 25th percentile for white men: 46.783246


display (_b[_cons] + 100*_b[parent_inc_rank]) - /// 
(_b[_cons] + 0*_b[parent_inc_rank])  
*Relative mobility for Black men: 29.431995
display (_b[_cons] + 100*_b[parent_inc_rank]) - /// 
(_b[_cons] + 0*_b[parent_inc_rank]) 
*Relative mobility for white men: 26.692104%


sum top20 if parent_inc_rank < 20 & (female == 0 & black == 1)
*Horatio Alger Measure for Black men: 5.78512
sum top20 if parent_inc_rank < 20 & (female == 0 & white == 1)
*Horatio Alger Measure for white men: 10.27027


sum more_than_parents if (female == 0 & black == 1) 
*Absolute mobility for Black men: 48.93314
sum more_than_parents if (female == 0 & white == 1)
*Absolute mobility for white men: 48.26347


*Question 7a:
sum kid_inc_rank if 21.5 < parent_inc_rank < 27.5 
*Binned average: 50.08672


*Question 7b (Statistic 1):
set seed 11534848
sample 50, count
regress kid_inc_rank parent_inc_rank
display _b[_cons] + 25*_b[parent_inc_rank] 
*Answer: 33.267741 is the absolute mobility at the 25th percentile for a random sample of 50 observations. 


*Question 7c:
sum kid_inc_rank if 21.5 < parent_inc_rank < 27.5
*45.51985 is the mean for the random sample.


*Question 7d: The average calculated in question 7c is a closer estimate to the full population estimate of 41.3 reported by Chetty et al. (2014).
