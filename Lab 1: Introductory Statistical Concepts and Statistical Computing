*Question 1: The graph was successfuly made.  
histogram kid_income
graph export histogram_dollars.png, replace
 
 *Question 2: The sample mean of kid_income is $70499.94.
sum kid_income

gen below_mean = 0
replace below_mean = 1 if kid_income < 70499.94

*Question 3: 
sum below_mean
*Answer:  59.6% of observations have kid_income below its mean. This fraction is not 50% because outliers or families with very high income can skew our mean to be much higher without the families. This skewing can make it seem as if $70,499.94 falls in the middle of the income distribution, and thus a fraction like 50% of families could fall above or beyond the value in terms of income. However, a majority of the sample make below the mean. If we wanted to a value in which 50% of the sample, we would have to work with the median.  

*Question 4: 
sum kid_income, d
*Answer: The sample median of kid_income is $58,750.

*Question 5:
sum kid_income
*Answer: The sample standard deviation of kid_income is $59552.02.

*Question 6:
gen withinoneSD = 0
replace withinoneSD = 1 if abs(kid_income - 70499.94) < 59552.02
sum withinoneSD

gen withintwoSDs = 0
replace withintwoSDs = 1 if abs(kid_income - 70499.94) < (59552.02*2)
sum withintwoSDs
*Answer: 78.7673% of observations are within one standard deviation of the mean of kid_income. 94.896% of observations fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

*Question 7:
egen kid_inc_rank = rank(kid_income)
sum kid_inc_rank
replace kid_inc_rank = 100*kid_inc_rank /r(max)
histogram kid_inc_rank 

sum kid_inc_rank, d

*Explanations behind code: "set seed" - in order for comp to generate a random number, you have to give it a seed. Regarding line 118, you are generating a random number between 0 and 1 (each kid in data set is assigned some number... e.g., .5, .7, etc.) (isn't an integer). "treatment_group" is a dummy variable... you could put an equal sign there (but doesn't make much a difference b/c it's unlikely that someone would be assigned .5) (theres'a n infinite number of random numbers/decimals , so the likelihood that you'd get 0.5 is unlikely)
*Note to self: the goal of the "gen x = runiform()" command is to give every observation a random number from 0 to 1 (with 1/2 with values below 0.5 -- uniform distribution). You then use that random number to split the observations, half into treatment (i.e. treatment = 1) and half into control (i.e. treatment = 0).
